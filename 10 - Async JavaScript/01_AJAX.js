// 01 Ajax : Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, while not a technology in itself, is a term coined in 2005 by 
// Jesse James Garrett, that describes a "new" approach to using a number of existing technologies together, 
// including HTML or XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, XML, XSLT, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object. 
// When these technologies are combined in the Ajax model, web applications are able to make quick, incremental
//  updates to the user interface without reloading the entire browser page. This makes the application faster 
//  and more responsive to user actions. Although X in Ajax stands for XML, JSON is preferred over XML nowadays
//   because of its many advantages such as being a part of JavaScript, 
// thus being lighter in size. Both JSON and XML are used for packaging information in the Ajax model.
// let i = 0;
// function ca(){
//     i++;
//     console.log(`${i}`);
//     setTimeout(ca,1000);
// }

// ca();
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 3));
